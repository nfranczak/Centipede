Part I deals with converting music into a form which the centipede can read and learn to play from

First we take a MIDI file (e.g. liz_et3.mid) and input it into midi2csv.py
        liz_et3.mid --> midi2csv.py --> liz copy.csv
        
Because the outputted CSV file contains a bunch of useless information we clean it with manipulating_csv.py
        liz copy.csv --> manipulating_csv.py --> new liz copy.csv
        
We then convert the outputted CSV file into a form that the centipede can 'read'
        new liz copy.csv --> csv2motor.py --> ready liz_et3.csv
Specifically, csv2motor.py takes the CSV file and compiles a row vector (n x 1) 
Here n represents the number of notes played in a given piece in chronological order
Each row of the vector has a specific format: the moment in time that the note should be played, the note itself, the attack of the finger, and the release

attack: how loud the note is in decibels
release: how long the note is in seconds

Things to fix:
1. create paths that route folders which contain MIDI or CSV files through the programs described above
2. Programs run on python 2.7 and not 3.x
