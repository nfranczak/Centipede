Part I deals with converting music into a form which the centipede can read and learn to play from. First we take a MIDI file
and convert it into CSV format using an online MIDICSV converter. Because the CSV file contains a bunch of useless information
the manipulating_csv.py program cleans the CSV file. The csv2motor.py program takes then takes the CSV file and compiles a
matrix of the form n x 1, where n represents the number of notes played in a given piece in chronological order. Each row of
the matrix has a specific format: the moment in time that the note should be played, the note itself, the attack of the finger,
and the release.
