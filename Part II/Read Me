Part II contains all the relevant code to 'contact' the centipede and feed it inputs given from csv2motor.py, along with a
model that is able to interpret the inputs and output the appropriate motor velocity and stall.
The intuition for the model is as follows. 
Let a be a function such that a: attack -> velocity
Let b         ''              b: release -> stall
we then can say that:
c: (attack x release) -> (velocity x stall)
&
d: (note x attack x release) -> (motor x velcity x stall)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input: (attack, release, note)
Training loop:
        nn produces:(vel, stall, motor) 
       (vel, stall) fed into arduino and executed by the chosen servo motor
        produced soundwave is redorded for amplitude and duration
        loss is measured
        nn refines itself
        
until the loss is below a certain thershold, lines 13-17 repeat.
once the threshold is met, the (attack, release, note) is then added to an R3 graph, &
                           the (velocity, stall, motor)    ''           a different R3 graph.
