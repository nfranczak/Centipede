Part II contains all the relevant code to contact the centipede and feed it inputs along with an RNN from which the cenitpede
can learn to play any composition from. Feeding the RNN because there are an infinite amount of combinations that can be
produced in terms of the attack on a note and how long it should sound for, a reinforcement neural network appropriately guages
how to correctly play a given note.The model simply outputs how fast a motor, which governs the movement of a finger, should 
actuate and how long it should hold the finger in a given position, which affects how long the note sounds for. The entire 
array passes through the model to get the appropriate parameters. These parameters are then fed to the centipede and a song is 
played.

* Note the final code for part II is still not finished so I will wait to 'publish' it*
For more information on the current progress of the code please contact me on my email (nfranczak@wesleyan.edu) and I will
share a copy of the current code along with explanations :)
