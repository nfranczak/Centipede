Currently, part II contains code that trains the centipede
A CSV file of csv2motor.py gets fed into finger.py

First the model checks if the given (note, attack, release) pair have already been approximated by the model with the lookup.py program

If not the model predicts a value for the corresponding motor's velocity and stall
* velocity corresponds to the attack *
* stall corresponds to the release *
The predicted (velocity, stall) get fed to the centipede with the ardu_comm.py program
At the same time the audyoo.py program is ran
The audyoo.py program records the attack and release that the velocity and stall produced
The loss is calculated between the produced (attack, release) and the desired (attack, release)
Until the loss is below a certain threshold the model keeps predicting (velocity, stall) values
Once the loss is below the threshold, the (velocity, stall, motor) values get added to a database with adder.py

visulizer.py can show the contents of the database in R3

A general intuition for the code described above
Let a be a function such that a: attack -> velocity
Let b         ''              b: release -> stall
we then can say that:
c: (attack x release) -> (velocity x stall)
&
d: (note x attack x release) -> (motor x velcity x stall)

Input: (attack, release, note)
Training loop:
        nn produces:(vel, stall, motor) 
       (vel, stall) fed into arduino and executed by the chosen  motor
        produced soundwave is redorded for amplitude and duration
        loss is measured
        nn refines itself
        
until the loss is below a certain thershold, lines 27-32 repeat
once the threshold is met, the (attack, release, note) is then added to an R3 graph, &
                           the (velocity, stall, motor)    ''           a different R3 graph

PLEASE NOTE PART II IS STILL IN THE WORKS
