# Bryce
A sentient 88-fingered centipede programmed to play the piano.
The 88-fingered centipede goes by the name Bryce, named after my good friend.
The code for this centipede can be broken down into three parts.
Part I deals with routing all possible MIDI files and converting them into an appropriate format so that they may be used as an input for Bryce.
Part II deals with a reinforcement neural network which allows Bryce to learn how to play any song perfectly.
Part III deals with another neural network responsible for enabling Bryce to create their own compositions.
