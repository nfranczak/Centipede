# Bryce
A 'sentient' 88-fingered centipede programmed to play the piano.
The 88-fingered centipede goes by the name Bryce, named after my good friend.
The code for this centipede can be broken down into three parts.
Part I deals with routing all possible MIDI files and converting them into an appropriate format so that they may be used as an input for Bryce.
Part II deals with a neural network which allows Bryce to learn how to play any song perfectly.
Part III deals with another neural network responsible for enabling Bryce to create their own compositions along with a user interface to allow for custom build pieces.
