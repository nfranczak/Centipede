# Bryce: An 88-fingered centipede programmed to play the piano.
I believe that before semi-intelligent robots become a ubiquitous household item humans will first have to feel comfortable
enough to have them living with them. To accelerate this feeling of acceptance a possible solution is to have robotics
viewed as art. I hope that the completion of this centipede allows my audience to see the general utility that robots can
provide masked by the aesthetics of this project.

The code can be broken down into three parts.
Part I deals with routing all possible MIDI files and converting them into an appropriate format so that they may be
used as an input for Bryce.
Part II deals with a model and relevant infastructure that allows Bryce to learn how to play any song perfectly.
Part III deals with another model responsible for enabling Bryce to create their own compositions.
