# Bryce
An 88-fingered centipede programmed to play the piano.
The code can be broken down into three parts.
Part I deals with routing all possible MIDI files and converting them into an appropriate format so that they may be used as an input for Bryce.
Part II deals with a model which allows Bryce to learn how to play any song perfectly.
Part III deals with another model responsible for enabling Bryce to create their own compositions along with a user interface to allow for custom build pieces.
